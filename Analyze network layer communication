Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT consultant services. Several customers contacted your company to report that they were not able to access the company website www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and saw the error “destination port unreachable” after waiting for the page to load. 

You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, you visit the website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” Next, you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and load the webpage again. This time, you receive a lot of packets in your network analyzer. The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets and receive an ICMP response returned to your host, the results contain an error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.” 
In the DNS and ICMP log, you find the following information:

In the first two lines of the log file, you see the initial outgoing request from your computer to the DNS server requesting the IP address of yummyrecipesforme.com. This request is sent in a UDP packet.

Next you find timestamps that indicate when the event happened. In the log, this is the first sequence of numbers displayed. For example: 13:24:32.192571. This displays the time 1:24 p.m., 32.192571 seconds.

The source and destination IP address is next. In the error log, this information is displayed as: 192.51.100.15.52444 > 203.0.113.2.domain. The IP address to the left of the greater than (>) symbol is the source address. In this example, the source is your computer’s IP address. The IP address to the right of the greater than (>) symbol is the destination IP address. In this case, it is the IP address for the DNS server: 203.0.113.2.domain

The second and third lines of the log show the response to your initial ICMP request packet. In this case, the ICMP 203.0.113.2 line is the start of the error message indicating that the ICMP packet was undeliverable to the port of the DNS server.

Next are the protocol and port number, which displays which protocol was used to handle communications and which port it was delivered to. In the error log, this appears as: udp port 53 unreachable. This means that the UDP protocol was used to request a domain name resolution using the address of the DNS server over port 53. Port 53, which aligns to the .domain extension in 203.0.113.2.domain, is a well-known port for DNS service. The word “unreachable” in the message indicates the message did not go through to the DNS server. Your browser was not able to obtain the IP address for yummyrecipesforme.com, which it needs to access the website because no service was listening on the receiving DNS port as indicated by the ICMP error message “udp port 53 unreachable.”

The remaining lines in the log indicate that ICMP packets were sent two more times, but the same delivery error was received both times. 


////////Now i am gonna Provide a summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP traffic log, Explain the analysis of the data and provide one possible cause of the incident////////
Part One: Summary of Problem Found in DNS and ICMP Traffic Log

Upon analyzing the DNS and ICMP traffic log, it becomes evident that the issue revolves around the inability to resolve the domain "yummyrecipesforme.com" to its corresponding IP address. The key findings from the log analysis are as follows:

Protocol Used: The ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is utilized for error reporting in this incident. Specifically, ICMP messages related to the "udp port 53 unreachable" error are prominent in the log.

Log Details: The log entries reveal a sequence of events:

Initial DNS Request: The log begins with an outgoing UDP packet sent from our computer to the DNS server (203.0.113.2) to request the IP address of "yummyrecipesforme.com."

ICMP Response: Following the DNS request, the log shows ICMP responses indicating that the ICMP packets sent to port 53 on the DNS server were "unreachable." This is signified by the error message "udp port 53 unreachable."

Repetition of ICMP Errors: Subsequent entries indicate that ICMP packets were sent multiple times, but the same "udp port 53 unreachable" error was received on each occasion.

Interpretation of Issues: The "udp port 53 unreachable" ICMP error message suggests that the DNS server (203.0.113.2) was not reachable over UDP port 53, which is the standard port used for DNS service. This indicates that our computer was unable to obtain the IP address for "yummyrecipesforme.com" from the DNS server, leading to the error "destination port unreachable" experienced by our users when trying to access the website.

Part Two: Analysis of Data and Suspected Root Cause

Based on the analysis of the data and the provided scenario, the following information is noteworthy:

Problem Report: The problem was initially reported when several customers were unable to access the company website, "www.yummyrecipesforme.com," and received a "destination port unreachable" error.

Scenario and Events: Upon visiting the website, the same error was encountered. Subsequently, the network analyzer tool (tcpdump) was used to capture traffic during an attempt to access the website. The analysis of the captured data indicated that ICMP error messages of "udp port 53 unreachable" were received in response to DNS requests.

Investigation Details: The investigation reveals that the issue is related to DNS resolution. Our computer attempted to query the DNS server (203.0.113.2) for the IP address of "yummyrecipesforme.com" using UDP packets on port 53, the standard DNS port. However, the ICMP error messages suggest that the DNS server was not reachable over this port, leading to the failure in obtaining the IP address.

Current Status: As of the current status, the issue persists, and users are still unable to access the website.

Suspected Root Cause: The most likely root cause of the problem is that the DNS server configured for resolving "yummyrecipesforme.com" is either not functioning correctly or not listening on UDP port 53. This is why our DNS requests are met with "udp port 53 unreachable" ICMP responses.

One Possible Solution:

To address this issue, the following steps can be taken:

DNS Server Check: Contact the administrator responsible for the DNS server (203.0.113.2) and confirm its operational status. Ensure that it is correctly configured to resolve "yummyrecipesforme.com."

Port Configuration: Verify that the DNS server is listening on UDP port 53. If not, configure it to do so.

DNS Resolution Testing: After making any necessary changes, perform testing to ensure that DNS resolution for "yummyrecipesforme.com" is functioning correctly. This can be done by sending test DNS queries to the server and verifying that it responds with the correct IP address.

Monitoring and Follow-Up: Continuously monitor the DNS service to ensure that the issue does not recur. Implement regular checks to maintain the service's functionality.

In conclusion, the analysis points to a DNS-related issue, specifically involving the DNS server's unresponsiveness on UDP port 53. By addressing the suspected root cause and implementing the suggested solution, we aim to resolve this incident and restore access to the website for our users. Further monitoring and testing will be necessary to confirm the resolution and prevent future occurrences.
